# Sprint Reflection – Sprint 1  
**Financial Transactions Summary Tool**

## What Went Well
- The team collaborated effectively using GitHub branches and pull requests.
- We maintained a consistent workflow across the sprint instead of “last-minute” work.
- Each story was traceable using Story IDs across Taiga and GitHub commits.
- Communication through our group chat helped keep everyone aligned.

## Challenges
- Coordinating merges and avoiding conflicts initially took some adjustment.
- Understanding Taiga workflows required a learning curve.
- Ensuring everyone had balanced workload distribution across stories.

## What We Would Improve Next Time
- Begin technical tasks earlier in the sprint.
- Hold short daily stand-ups to sync progress.
- Improve documentation as we code instead of at the end.

## Application of Agile Principles
We followed Scrum elements: a sprint goal, user stories, story points, tasks, and daily progress.  
We used iterative development, continuous integration through GitHub, and regular collaboration.  
Our Definition of Done helped maintain consistent quality and ensured every story met acceptance criteria before merging.
