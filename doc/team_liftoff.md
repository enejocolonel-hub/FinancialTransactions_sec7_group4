# Team Liftoff – Financial Transactions Summary Tool  
**Section 7 – Group 4**

## Mission
To collaboratively build a reusable Python module that loads, cleans, and summarizes the Financial Transactions Dataset. Our mission is to apply Agile practices—iterations, collaboration, and traceability—while producing a functional tool that supports future analytics and dashboards.

## Vision
Deliver a clean and modular codebase, supported by well-planned user stories, daily progress, continuous GitHub activity, and evidence of collaboration using branches, pull requests, and reviews.

## Success Priorities
1. Deliver all core summary functions working correctly.
2. Maintain consistent GitHub commits across the sprint (not last-day).
3. Proper Taiga board management with tasks moving through workflow.
4. High-quality documentation and traceability (Story IDs in commits & PRs).

## Working Agreements
- No one commits directly to `main`.
- One branch per feature or user story.
- Every Pull Request requires at least one reviewer approval.
- Daily updates via group chat and Taiga.
- Merge only when tasks meet Acceptance Criteria and Definition of Done.

## Definition of Done (DoD)
A story is “Done” when:
- Code runs without errors.
- Function meets all acceptance criteria.
- Branch merged via reviewed pull request.
- Tasks moved to "Done" in Taiga.
- Documentation updated.
